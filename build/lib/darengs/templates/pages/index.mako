DARE-NGS is a Gateway for Next Generation Sequence data analysis. DARE-NGS supports Genome-wide analysis --
which is both computationally and data-intensive. DARE-NGS builds upon the Dynamic Application Runtime-Environment (DARE) Framework, 
and is one of several Science Gateways for Life Science Applications built using DARE.
</p>
<p>
Gateways enable non-experts to seamlessly utilize High-Performance and Distributed Computing resources, such as the NSF's national production cyberinfrastructure
-- XSEDE, regional cyberinfrastructure resources such as LONI. DARE-based Gateways can be extended to utilize campus/departmental clusters too.
</p>
<p>
Currently, users can run BFast for mapping. More tools are coming. 
Currently DARE-NGS uses LONI and TeraGrid resources for production and FutureGrid-Clouds for testing. 
DARE-NGS will be made available for a broad range of private and commercial Cloud Services in Summer 2011.
